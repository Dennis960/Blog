Hopping Adventure is a simple game where you have to jump over obstacles to get as far as possible. The game was developed using Unity and published on the Google Play Store.

The concept is simple: You control a character that is formed as a ball. The character automatically bounces up and down. When pressing the screen on the left or right side, the character will move in that direction. The goal is to jump over obstacles, collect coins and gems, buy items and reach the end of each level.

At some point in development I encountered some funny bugs (which are fixed now). Here is a video of one of them:

Sadly I did not have the motivation to continue development and at some point the game did not follow the Google Play Store guidelines anymore. Therefore I removed the game from the store.

The game also included Unity Ads and rewarded videos. only a handful of people downloaded the game so I only earned 1 cent, but it was a fun experience to develop a game and publish it on the Google Play Store.
