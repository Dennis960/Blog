At some point a classmate of mine brought a magic cube to school and I was fascinated by it.
I had one myself, but I never really got into it.

That day I went home, took out my magic cube, sat in front of the TV, started the first YouTube tutorial I found and started solving it.

Over time I accumulated a few more magic cubes and I even got into speedcubing for a bit.

{{< gallery "MagicCube (1).jpg,MagicCube (2).jpg,MagicCube (3).jpg,MagicCube (4).jpg,MagicCube (5).jpg,MagicCube (6).jpg,MagicCube (7).jpg,MagicCube (8).jpg,MagicCube (9).jpg,MagicCube (10).jpg,MagicCube (11).jpg,MagicCube (12).jpg,MagicCube (13).jpg" "Magic Cube 1::Magic Cube 2::Magic Cube 3::Magic Cube 4::Magic Cube 5::Magic Cube 6::Magic Cube 7::Magic Cube 8::Magic Cube 9::Magic Cube 10::Magic Cube 11::Magic Cube 12::Magic Cube 13" >}}

I can still solve the 3x3x3 cubes but forgot how to solve the other ones.
