I am Dennis and I was born in Germany in 2003.
As a hobby I started to play the piano in 2010 and I like to create and develop software. On this blog I want to share my work with you and let you look into my progress.
I am good at maths by the way and I tend to do things that take multiple weeks or even months to complete.
As of writing this (beginning of 2021) my main languages are Python, Java and C#.
