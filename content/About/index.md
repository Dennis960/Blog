I am Dennis and I was born in Germany in 2003.
As a hobby I started to play the piano in 2010 and I like to create and develop software. On this blog I want to share my work with you and let you look into my progress.
I am good at maths by the way and I tend to do things that take multiple weeks or even months to complete.
As of writing this (beginning of 2021) my main languages are Python, Java and C#.

Update (end of 2024):

I still like to play with software and hardware.
My main languages are Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and Java.
But I also used or learned these languages (sorted by how much I remember):

- Python
- Javascript/TypeScript
- Svelte
- Java
- Markdown
- HTML/CSS
- SQL
- C/C++
- Haskell
- Shell

From here it gets difficult

- C#
- Armv7 Assembly
- WebAssembly

And some fun ones

- Scratch
- Snap!
- Tailwind (does this count?)
- GDScript
